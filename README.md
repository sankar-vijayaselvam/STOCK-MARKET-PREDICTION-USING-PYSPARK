# STOCK-MARKET-PREDICTION-USING-PYSPARK

# Project Description

This project focuses on predicting stock market trends using PySpark. It leverages machine learning techniques to analyze stock data and build predictive models for future price movements.

# Purpose

The goal of this project is to explore different machine learning models for stock price prediction, evaluate their performance, and determine the most effective approach for financial forecasting.

# Dataset Used

The model uses a CSV dataset containing historical stock market data, including the following attributes:

- Open Price

- Close Price

- High Price

- Low Price

- Volume

- Adjusted Prices

# Key Insights

- Linear Regression had the best performance based on RMSE.


# Features

- ing and handling missing values

- Feature engineering (encoding, scaling, transformations)

# Machine Learning models:

- Linear Regression

- Random Forest Regressor

- Decision Tree Regressor

- Gradient Boosting Regressor

- Model evaluation using RMSE

# Prerequisite

- Ensure you have PySpark installed. If not, install it using:

- pip install pyspark



# Results

- The models were evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE):

- Linear Regression: 0.88

- Random Forest: 2.55

- Decision Tree: 3.28

- GBT Regressor: 3.19
